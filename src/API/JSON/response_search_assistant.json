  "shooper_assistant_answer": "You're looking for the 2023 Ngeringa Pinot Noir, huh?  Well, you've got great taste!  This wine is a real gem, made with biodynamic, minimal intervention methods. It's got a bright and energetic character that's true to its Adelaide Hills origin.  But hey, why stop there?  You should also check out the 2023 Ngeringa 'Small Batch' Sangiovese.  It's a bit darker and plusher, with a round and plump ripeness.  Think of it as the bolder sibling to the Pinot Noir.  Both of these wines are made with the same care and attention to detail, so you can't go wrong with either one!
